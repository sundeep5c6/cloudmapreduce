#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

Generic roadmap, for collaborative discussion.

= Details =

 * Test cases/Continuous integration (possibly migrate to Maven?)
  * Have started with the Maven skeleton, will work on a e2e integration test first.
 * More sample MapReduce applications to show people how to use it
 * Support for cascaded MapReduce
 * Rethink the MapReduceApp class to make it easier for people to write applications
 * Performance optimization (code never gone through a profiler yet)
 * Cost optimization in DBManager. Look for ways to minimize database queries to reduce SimpleDB cost.
 * Visual monitoring tool to watch job progress. (All statuses are in SimpleDB, this tool just need to query SimpleDB to get a clear view)
 * Clearly separate out the cloud dependent stuff from non-cloud-dependent stuff, to make it easy to support other cloud platforms in the future
 * Support an internal cloud instantiation. Need to lock in a platform to be based on. Possible choices are ActiveMQ, Voldemort, CouchDB, Mnesia, MongoDB, Neo4J, Tokoyo Cabinet
